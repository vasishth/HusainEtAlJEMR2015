      abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. 
      We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the 
      University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu 
      treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass 
      reading times, regression path duration, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length 
      results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer 
      syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence 
      comprehension diffi- culty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost 
      (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost 
      (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted 
      heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage 
      cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early 
      and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. 
      This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence 
      reading difficulty.},
